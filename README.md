# search-v2-infrastructure
IaC definitions for GOV.UK Search v2

This repository contains Terraform resource definitions to set up Google Cloud's Vertex AI Search
(also previously known as "Gen App Builder" or in the APIs as "Discovery Engine") for use as a
search engine for GOV.UK through [`search-api-v2`][search-api-v2-repo], and to set up a data
pipeline for analytics events to feed into the search engine model.

It is applied through a set of Terraform Cloud workspaces (one per environment).

## Prerequisites
### Google Cloud Platform
This Terraform configuration operates on a per-project level in GCP, which means some prior manual
setup is required before the configuration can be applied. For an environment named `example`, you
will need the following items set up:
- A Google Cloud Platform project (`search-api-v2-example`) with billing enabled
- A service account within the project (`search-api-v2-example-tf`)
  - _TODO: List roles/permissions required for service account_

> **Note**
> In addition, Vertex AI Search currently (October 2023) requires an extra step of manually
> accepting terms and conditions through the Console UI that cannot be performed programatically,
> and API calls will fail until this is done. We expect this to change in the near future.

### Terraform Cloud
For an environment named `example`, you will need the following items set up:
- A workspace (`search-v2-infrastructure-example`) in the `govuk-search-api-v2` project, with the
  following variables:
  - `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable configured to the GCP project's service account
  credentials from above (see [Google provider documentation][google_provider_docs])
  - `gcp_project_id` Terraform variable set to the GCP project name (`search-api-v2-example`)

## Terraform configuration files
- `main.tf`: General Terraform and provider configuration and activates the required GCP APIs
  (prerequisite for other resources)
- `discovery_engine.tf`: Sets up Discovery Engine resources

> **Note**
> The Discovery Engine resources are managed through the [RestAPI provider][restapi_provider_docs]
> due to the Google provider not offering first party Terraform resources yet (as of October 2023).

## Development containers
The workspace can be run as a devcontainer which includes Terraform and the `gcloud` CLI. A
gitignored `.terraform.credentials.d` directory is included in the repository, which is mounted into
the devcontainer's home folder for `terraform login` to store Terraform Cloud tokens into (so they
persist across container rebuilds). This directory will contain sensitive information, so do not
stop it being gitignored or force any files within to be checked in.
